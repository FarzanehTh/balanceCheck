# BalanceCheck  
  
## Iteration 1 - Review & Retrospect

  ### Review meeting
  
Date: Friday October 12, 2018, 1-3pm  
Location: BA3200, In person  
  
## Process - Reflection  
  
#### Decisions that turned out well  
  

-   Organised team planning using Trello
    

	-   Trello creates a visual set of tasks so that it is clear what is being worked on, and what needs to be worked on
    

-   Google Drive + Google Docs
    

	-   Using Google Drive as a temporary repo before the team repo was set up as well as to share images/prototype/links
    
	-   Using Google Docs for collaborating with other members
    

-   Set up weekly meetings using Doodle
    

	-   Using Doodle allowed the team to be able to find the best dates when we would have meetings catering to everyone's schedules. In turn, we found that Fridays from 1-3pm were the optimal meeting time for our group.
    

  

  
#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped  
  
-   Bringing all team members up to speed with required software and installations
   
-   Some of the installation processes did not function properly on non-windows Operating systems

-   Google Docs is not the perfect tools for creating .md file. Converting google docs to .md was not as easy as we thought. We should have used another platform to type our .md like Stackedit
    
-   Initially creating an independent group repository, before the project repo was available

-   This forced team members to delete their previously cloned repos and build the project again
    

  
#### Planned changes  
-   Find a solution to install and set up web application for non-Windows environments
   
-   Many team members cannot set up the web application due to the fact that their OSâ€™s do not support our installation method
    

-   Assign review assignments for team members to learn markdown
    

-   Instead of editing the Google Doc, team member will be able to commit to to the repository, which is already formatted in markdown. Thus, we can see contributing commits from team members who are editing the deliverables.
    

## Product - Review  
  
#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:  
 

1. Finalized and agreed on the idea for the project

2. Decided on the technologies we plan to use for each aspect of the project (front end, backend etc.), as well as the repo being setup  
3. Assigned roles for each team member

4. Created a Trello page with Backlog, Review, In Progress and Done boards to keep track of tasks that need to be done

5. Agreed upon a time to meet weekly that works for everyone

6. Understood all the technologies that we use in the project

7. Researched how to create a web server

8. Set up the project environment and pushed the project to the team repo

  

  
#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:  

1.  Environment setups were not completely successful for users with OS, as there are unknown errors.
    

  
## Meeting Highlights  
  
#### Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:  
  
 - List out the all the main features of our web application and break down into small tasks or implementation
 - prioritize the featues and functionalites that we plan for the web appliation to have and make sure we put the minimum requirement on the top
 - Assist all team members to set up the web application. This must be completed so that each member can work on the product and launch the application.
 - Define rules for github (pull/push/create branch)

 
#### Other
-  Research a fix for MacOS user
-  Everyone should start coding with their assigned roles
 - Report any problems they encounter during the development phase
 - Always ask if something was not explained well or went wrong
