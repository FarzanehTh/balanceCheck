## Q1: What are you planning to build?
Currently, several web organizations are making attempts to deliberately promote disinformation and biased opinions to attract people to come to their websites.

Potentially, people will believe what they read and see on these websites as a reliable resource for news. Because these websites are getting more and more popular and increased daily traffic, other news media websites are impacted by this. Wikipedia has listed over 70 new websites that deliver fake news through social media platforms, such as Facebook. Therefore, there are many users that are reading articles and learning information that may be biased or even false.

  

BalanceCheck is the perfect solution to solve this problem. BalanceCheck’s primary product is a web application, with a search function to allow searching for articles to obtain their current rating. Articles will be searchable by URL or by text search. It allows people to vote on the fairness and balance of online reporting so that any article or post will be given a weighted grade reflecting the userbase’s opinion of the news item’s objectivity. BalanceCheck also provides users to express their opinions in a systematic way. Rather than labeling some news media website as unreliable, BalanceCheck let the user view different new media websites by rank (biased/neutral/unreliable, etc) as well as the evidence (poorly rated articles) that support their rating.

  

This product is important because it creates a service to find the most unbiased articles and information on the web. This is crucial for users who normally read web pages and online news sources that are filled with bias and fake news. It has become very difficult in this time to find a source of news that is trustworthy and unaffected by any form of bias.

  

A browser extension will allow instant, one-click voting on the current webpage, as well as displaying the rating (if available) of the current page open in the browser.


## Q2: Who are your target users?

1. Research Student.

A university student who needs research from online sources for their upcoming paper

2. Non-tech savvy reader.

## Q3: Why would your users choose your product? What are they using today to solve their problem/need?

BalanceCheck offers users a fast, easy, and simple way to get an initial notion of the objectivity of the article they are reading right now.

  
While there are a few other services attempting to find solutions for this problem, such as AllSides, most of them rely on a core team of employees, who rate publications political bias.

  

BalanceCheck, on the other hand, will gain the trust of the users by giving the power back to the public; Users with a (free) account can vote on articles they read and rate them for their accuracy, and lack of slant.

  

For example, many Students, when writing essays, assignments, and other projects, need to conduct copious amounts of research which involves taking articles from online news sources. Students need to make sure that their sources are academically sourced, and also correct in their information.

This also includes Users who are conducting research and are looking for viable, trustworthy information.

  

Additionally, potential Users for our service are less tech-savvy people who are easily tricked or click-baited into reading the fake news. With a huge influx of fake news in our social media platforms, BalanceCheck helps fact-check articles for people who less able to distinguish fake news from a genuine source.
